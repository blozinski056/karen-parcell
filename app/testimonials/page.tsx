            &quot;Karen was such an amazing asset to have while searching for a
            house. She heard our concerns, listened to all our questions, and
            really advocated for us when it came time to negotiate. It felt like
            she was helping family look for houses and really cared about
            getting us into the perfect spot! She was such a blessing to have by
            our side!&quot;

            &quot;I had a wonderful experience. Karen is extremely knowledgeable
            and was there through every step of the way. I had complete trust
            and faith in everything she did regarding the property. She went
            above and beyond in selling the house. She was able to get
            everything we wanted. She is an overall amazing person.&quot;

            &quot;I have no idea what my friends and I would have done without
            Karen. You could say that she was the glue that held everything
            together. Karen was quick with her responses, got along well with
            other realtors, knew Los Angeles like the back of her hand, and made
            negotiating a price a seamless process. Karen has a way of standing
            up for what she knows is right while still being respectful. Because
            of Karen, me and my best friends are living in our dream home. She
            is the best realtor I’ve ever met. I highly recommend!&quot;

            &quot;We used Karen as our agent for buying and selling a property
            with a 7-year break. She was fairly new to the industry when we
            bought the property but kept us sane during the process. When we
            sold the property, 7 years later, she was persistent and brought in
            the perfect buyer. We used her to purchase another property as well
            in an area she wasn’t familiar with and she did an excellent job.
            Obviously, we recommend her highly to anyone.&quot;

            &quot;We loved working with Karen for our first house purchase. We
            are so grateful to have worked with her especially on a first home.
            She took time to learn about us, our family (kids) and needs. Karen
            spent almost a year with us until we found the house we loved, she
            was incredible patient and showed so much grace through the process.
            She cheered us on and didn’t want us to settle for something we
            didn’t love. Karen came with us to almost all open houses we wanted
            to see (and there were many) and gave us really good advice on each
            one, educating us. We also received many options that allowed us to
            determine what we want in a house. She truly cares about her clients
            and wants to make sure they are taken care of. She knows the
            business and knows exactly what to ask the sellers. She is super
            prompt on all offers and worked so well with our lawyer also. In
            short, Karen puts her clients first. She becomes your family member.
            That’s how much care we received from her.&quot;

            &quot;The most amazing agent I have ever worked with. She was beyond
            knowledgeable, providing many adequate listings as well as offering
            great insight into pros and cons of properties viewed. She has great
            relationships with other agents as well, making viewings easily
            accessible. She is beyond accommodating, and continued to work with
            us after the lease was secured. Has gone above and beyond to make us
            feel safe and comfortable throughout the whole process, while
            helping to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible. I highly
            recommend her to anyone looking for a new apartment or home. She
            treats her clients as family and overall has been the best
            ever!!!!&quot;

            &quot;I highly recommend Karen Parcell as an outstanding real estate
            agent for the Los Angeles area. She is professional, incredibly
            knowledgeable of the market, hardworking, always available. Karen
            helped me find the dream Beverly Hills condo for my aging parents
            within six weeks of search; she has helped me discover nooks of the
            neighborhood I didn&apos;t know existed and ultimately helped me
            make a great choice and navigate savvily a property that had
            multiple offers. You are in great hands with Karen, no matter in
            what neighborhood of Los Angeles you are looking to buy.&quot;

            listens to clients needs and finds that perfect location. I highly

            &quot;Karen helped me and my husband buy our 1st home last year. In
            a tough market where many buyers were coming in with higher than
            asking price or all cash offers, Karen negotiated an amazing deal
            for us. She really understands the market place and researched the
            particulars of our home. She’s extremely professional and has a
            great network of inspectors and contractors to help ensure the
            quality of the home. She was always accessible and flexible with her
            time. We really love Karen and could not recommend her more.&quot;

            &quot;Karen is wonderful, attentive and devotes herself
            whole-heartedly to her clients. Top notch! I first approached Ms.
            Parcell over 5 years ago when I was considering selling my home and
            purchasing another in another area. After running all the numbers
            and seeing the equity I had built on my home and it’s positives, she
            advised me that while she would love to represent me as both a buyer
            and seller, it was in my best interest to remain in my current
            residence. It’s rare to find that honesty, especially since she was
            to gain a lot from representing me. She goes out of her way to make
            sure you are getting the best personal attention.&quot;

            &quot;I wont work with anyone else but Karen! She was so
            knowledgeable, and helpful though my first home buying process. She
            was patient, but also a strong headed women who got what I needed
            and wanted. I really trust her, her opinions and I don&apos;t have
            one bad thing to say about my experience working with her. Cant wait
            to do it all again hopefully soon!&quot;
