# Personal Website for a Real Estate Agent (my friend's mom!)

Check out the website [here](https://www.karenparcellhomes.com/)

My friend's mom asked me to create a personal website for her because her old website felt busy, clunky, and outdated. My goal was to keep her website simple, organized, clean, and professional in order to attract clients.

Since she is primarily working with clients in West Los Angeles, I wanted to create a website with warm and light, sand and ocean colors of the beach. She liked the colors, but, unfortunately, I could not keep the gray-blue ![#3f7d96](https://placehold.co/15x15/3f7d96/3f7d96.png) `#3f7d96` colored accents because it conflicted with her Real Estate agency's colors (maroon of Berkshire Hathaway).

I had fun creating this multi-page website using Next.js, and I implemented a paralax scroll for the first time!

She requested that I show her accolades, while also keeping the testimonials from her [previous page](https://karenparcell.com/).
